[Deployed Workout Tracker!](https://workout-track-8000.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This application tracks a users workout information and provides graphs to track their progress.


## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


## Usage

When the user navigates to the site they will find the workout tracker.

When selecting "New Workout" the user is given an option between choosing "Resistance" or "Cardio" and then will need to fill out the relevant information about their workout. They can also choose to "Continue Workout" and add more information to the current workout they are completing.

After returning to the main page, the user will see the information of the last workout displayed on the screen.

If the user would like more information about past workouts they can navigate to the "dashboard" found on the top left of the page. There they will find various graphs detailing their workout history.
